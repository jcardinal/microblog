# Flask Mega-Tutorail: microblog

Working my way through Miguel Grinberg's excellent [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). I'm mostly sticking to the given code, but may adapt here and there to try things out. eg; I've learned about Python's f-strings and I think I prefer them over str.format in most of the instances where those are used in this tutorial.
